# Challange Statements

## Context

Healthcare access in Bangladesh faces numerous challenges, deeply rooted in infrastructural gaps, economic limitations, and cultural factors. Remote areas lack sufficient medical facilities and specialists, while urban centers grapple with overcrowded clinics and extended wait times.
